    <h3>Description</h3>
    Donairs have been one of my favorite meals for as long as I can remember. Now that I'm an adult I find making
    them at home to be the best way to enjoy them. While the process takes a bit of effort the taste when you can
    control the seasonings is much better than anything you can buy.
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 lb Ground Beef</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp Dried Oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Garlic Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Onion Powder</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Black Pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Italian Seasoning</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp Cayenne Powder</li>
        <li>1 tsp Salt</li>
        <li>1 tsp flour</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onion</li>
        <li>Pita</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat over to 375</li>
        <li>Place ground beef in a large metal bowl</li>
        <li>Add all seasoning to ground beef</li>
        <li>Blend seasonings in with ground beef well. The seasonings should be mixed in well</li>
        <li>Knead the seasoned beef by forming all ball and throwing it into the bowl, repeat 20 times</li>
        <li>Shape well kneaded beef into a loaf</li>
        <li>Bake for 60-95 minutes, until no longer pink</li>
        <li>Slice tomato and onion while loaf is cooking</li>
        <li>Slice and serve on warmed pita with garlic donair sauce and chopped veggies</li>
    </ol>
